# React Component Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a component consists of the series of events that happen from its mounting (creation) to its unmounting (destruction).

## Phases Detailed

1.  **Mounting**: The birth of your component.
2.  **Updating**: The growth of your component.
3.  **Unmounting**: The death of your component.

**Note on Phases:**
*   **Render Phase**: Pure and has no side effects. React may pause, abort, or restart work here. (Includes `render`, `shouldComponentUpdate`).
*   **Commit Phase**: Can work with DOM, run side effects, schedule updates. (Includes `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`).

## Lifecycle Methods

### render()
*   **Phase**: Mounting, Updating
*   **Description**: The only required method in a class component. It examines `this.props` and `this.state` and returns React elements.
*   **Note**: `render()` should be pure, meaning it does not modify component state, returns the same result each time it’s invoked, and does not directly interact with the browser.

### componentDidMount()
*   **Phase**: Mounting
*   **Description**: Invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree).
*   **Usage**: Perfect for making API calls, setting up subscriptions, or initializing state that requires DOM nodes.

### componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
*   **Phase**: Updating
*   **Description**: Invoked immediately after updating occurs. This method is not called for the initial render.
*   **Usage**: Good for operating on the DOM when the component has been updated. Also useful for making network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props to avoid infinite loops.

### componentWillUnmount()
*   **Phase**: Unmounting
*   **Description**: called immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed.
*   **Usage**: Used for cleanup tasks like invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up subscriptions created in `componentDidMount`.

## Rarely Used Methods
*   **shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)**: Optimization to let React know if the component’s output is not affected by current changes.
*   **static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)**: Invoke right before calling the render method, both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates.
*   **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)**: Invoked right before the most recently rendered output is committed to the DOM.

## Error Boundaries
Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.
*   **static getDerivedStateFromError(error)**: Render a fallback UI after an error has been thrown.
*   **componentDidCatch(error, info)**: Log error information.
